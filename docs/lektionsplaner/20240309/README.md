# 2024-03-09 Lesson plan

For Processing, we want the learners to work together more.
Goals are: (1) learners get to know each other, (2) learners
feel more involved in the course, (3) shorter queue to get access to teachers.

One way to do that, is to form teams based on skill level.
What are rules for teams?

Procedure:

- Order learners from lesson cards
- If 1 diplom: free to do whatever
- Else
  - Group of 2 always joins another group
  - Group of 10 always splits up
- Group decides on:
  - a name
  - a logo
  - how to get in the group
- You may change group if that group agrees!
