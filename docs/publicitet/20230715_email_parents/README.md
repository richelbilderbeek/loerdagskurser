Dear parents/caretakers [1, 2, 3],

After last evaluation, there now is a Lördagskurs email list.
You can subscribe to it at <https://www.freelists.org/list/loerdagskurser> [4].
From now on, I will send emails there when there is a new flyer.

As an early warning: the nearby agenda for the Summer holiday is:

* Saturday 2023-07-22: Pi Approximation Day, 7:22 @ Uppsala Slott:

   more info at <https://github.com/richelbilderbeek/ums_0ad_turnering_2023>
