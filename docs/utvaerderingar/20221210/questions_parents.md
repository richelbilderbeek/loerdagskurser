# Questions for parents 2022-12-10

## Email policy

Richel creates temporary emails to use Codeberg,
a programming website.

* Is this a fine workaround that properly respects parents' choise
   to not let their kids use email?

## Use of Discord

Most kids use Discord, a chat program similar to Slack, Trello, Matrix,
and Microsoft Teams. For Discord one needs to be 13 years old.
Kids have to lie about their age and Richel is clear that they
indeed need to lie and that he thinks that is terrible as well.
However, Discord is useful for team work and without Discord,
kids will feel missing out.

For Discord, kids need an email address and Richel sometimes create
temporary ones.

* Is this policy good enough?

## Communication

At the course, the kids get handed out flyers,
as well as the website is updated frequently,
to remove the need for emails.
Richel does send out reminders per email, to parents he has the email address of.

* Is the information good enough?
* Should email reminders be sent at all?
* Should there be an email list?

## Amount of activities

Is the amount of activities right?
Is it too much, fine, or would more be welcome as well?

This season/term/half-year, there are these activities (we'll
go through these later):

* Kulturnatten
* Slutpresentation
* Efterfarsdag

### How was Kulturnatten?

At Kulturnatten, most kids helped.

* Did the kids enjoy it?
* Did the parents felt that their kids were taken care of properly?

### How was Slutpresentation?

* Feeling welcome when entering?
* Kids taking care of guests?
* Adults giving guided tours through the Makerspace?
* Or: is it felt compensated for that parents need to wait
   until all kids are ready to present?
* Presentations: good length or too long or too short?

### How was Efterfarsdag?

Efterfarsdag is an experiment in which the kids teach their
father/uncle/grandfather.

* As a parent, how did you enjoy the Efterfarsdag?
* Do it again next year?
