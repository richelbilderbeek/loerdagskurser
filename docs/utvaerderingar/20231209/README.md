## Reflection

It seems the learners that stayed in the course (there is a survivorship
bias here!) seem happy. The grades of courses seem to be the same.

The ideas to add Godot and pixelart seem nice. What is lacking for both
are (1) people, (2) booklets, where the first is the limiting factor.

That learners want more and longer courses is encouraging.
However, we do not have the people and space for this. 

With the teachers, we all felt that the course is going fine. 
The weakest point, we felt, is the Arduino course, 
which is too tough for most of our learners.
I will simplify the booklets.
